# MCMC Benchmarking

This repository is created for you to test your MCMC (or other inference) algorithms.
We provide various benchmark problems, together with results from our Hamiltonian Monte
Carlo and Metropolis-Hastings samplers, in addition to basic analysis.

Please find all configurations on which you can run benchmarks in [`./benchmarks`](benchmarks).
Our actual statistical models can be found in `./models`.
